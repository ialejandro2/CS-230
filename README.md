# The Gaming Room - Software Design Document

## Project Summary
The Gaming Room is a company that wanted to expand its Android-only game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a web-based platform that works across multiple systems. They needed a scalable, efficient, and secure solution. My design used object-oriented principles and patterns like Singleton and Iterator to manage game data, ensure unique names, and support distributed web deployment.

## Reflection Questions

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**  
I clearly explained how the Singleton and Iterator patterns would help with memory management and data integrity, which were critical to meeting the project’s requirements. I also made strong recommendations for system architecture, like choosing a Linux-based cloud server for scalability.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**  
Writing the design document helped me plan how the different parts of the system would connect, especially through RESTful APIs and a client-server model. It gave me a clear roadmap for how classes like GameService, Team, and Player would interact, making the coding process smoother.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**  
I would expand the System Architecture View by adding diagrams showing how microservices would interact through the cloud. Visuals would make the distributed system design even easier for the client and developers to understand.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**  
I focused on scalability, cross-platform access, and memory efficiency, because The Gaming Room wanted to grow their user base while keeping performance high. It's crucial to prioritize user needs so the final software is functional, scalable, and matches the client’s expectations.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**  
I used an object-oriented approach with an emphasis on modularity and reusability, supported by proven design patterns. In the future, I would continue using modular design but also incorporate earlier user feedback and mockup testing to catch improvements even before the full coding phase.
